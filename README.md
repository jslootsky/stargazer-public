## How to run locally

0. **Clone this repo into a directory**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cis3296f25/final-project-01-stargazer.git
   ```

1. **CD Into Repo and Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   > If your network restricts direct npm registry access, configure an internal proxy or mirror before installing.
   > If you receive an error "npm not recognize" install node.js from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

2. **Install backend dependencies**
   Upgrade pip and install requirements
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
   ```
   >if ```requirements.txt``` does not exist, generate one with 
   >   ```
   >   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   >   ``` 

3. **Environment variables**
   Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and set your keys:
   ```dotenv
   VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=
   VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```
   `VITE_API_BASE_URL` is optional—when omitted the dev server proxies `/api` to `http://localhost:5000`.
   
   **How to get a Google Maps API key:**
   1. Visit the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/
   2. Create or select a project.
   3. Go to **APIs & Services → Library** and enable:
      - **Maps JavaScript API**
      - (Optional) Places API, Geocoding API, Elevation API
   4. Go to **APIs & Services → Credentials** → **Create Credentials → API Key**.
   5. Copy the key and restrict it:
      - Under **Application restrictions**: choose “HTTP referrers (websites)”.
      - Add:  
        `http://localhost:5173/*`  
        (and your production domain, if any)
      - Under **API restrictions**: restrict to Maps JavaScript API.
   6. Paste the key into `.env` as `VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=...`.


5. **Start the flask backend**
   On a separate terminal in the backend directory
   ```
   python stargazer.py
   ```

6. **Start the dev server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open the printed URL (default `http://localhost:5173`). Requests to `/api` are proxied to the Flask backend to avoid CORS issues.


## Running Tests

### Running All Tets
From the project root
```bash
pytest -v
```

### Running Tests With Coverage
1. Install the coverage plugin:
   ```bash
   pip install pytest-cov
   ```
2. Run with coverage reporting:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=stargazer --cov-report=term-missing
   ```

   - ```--cov=stargazer``` measures coverage for the stargazer module
   - ```--cov-report=term-missing``` shows uncovered lines directly in the terminal
   - Optional: 
      ```bash
      pytest --cov=stargazer --cov-report=html
      ```
      Opens a detailed HTML coverage report in the ```htmlcov/``` folder
